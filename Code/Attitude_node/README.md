Add all files in this directory along with:
  /Code/Libs/C/{CanMessages.c, CircularBuffer.c, Ecan1.c, MessageScheduler.c, Node.c, Timer2.c, Stack.s, Traps.c, Uart1.c}
  /Code/Libs/MPU60xx/*.c

You need to make sure `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` were run and that `/Code/Libs/MPU60xx` exists with code inside.
