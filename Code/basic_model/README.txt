Full_sim.mdl - Implements a complete simulator. Desired missions are set via the missions.m file in /Code/Libs/MATLAB/missions.m file.

HIL_sim.mdl - Implements the environment simulation where the controller is running on actual hardware, connected to via a UDP connection. This requires the boat hardware, with the HIL node connected directly via Ethernet and the controller node connected to it via CAN.

Plant.mdl - This model isn't run directly, but is included by the 3 simulation files.

Replay_sim.mdl - Replays a CSV data log (generated by mavlogdump.py from the MAVLink project) and a given autonomous portion of the run in open loop. It calls Replay_sim_init.m to set up its runtime environment.

Replay_sim_init.m - This shouldn't be called directly. Called automatically by Replay_sim.mdl on playback. Sets up its runtime environment.

Replay_sim_visualize.m - [INCOMPLETE] Displays some graphs showing the difference in controls outputs between the played-back data and data generated by the controller.

simulation_constants.m - Sets up some runtime constants for all of the simulators in this folder.
