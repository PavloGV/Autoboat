/**
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This library contains a message scheduler designed for transmission of both repeating messages
 * and one off messages. It attempts to schedule new messages over timesteps with the lowest amount
 * of data necessary for transmission. This library is timestep agnostic, but only supports 100
 * timesteps at this point.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * This library has no prerequisites outside of the C standard library.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * 1) Set your code to call `IncrementTimestep()` at 100Hz and to process the list of message IDs.
 * 2) Add an initialization function to add all desired repeating messages using AddMessage*().
 * 3) Add support for a heap (probably at least 512). This library relies on malloc() and free(). 
 * 4) That's it! If you'd like to change the dispatched messages you may at any time.
 *
 * TESTING:
 * A unit-testing framework is built-in to this library and available by running with the UNIT_TEST
 * preprocessor macro defined. For example: 
 *   `gcc MessageScheduler.c -DUNIT_TEST -g -Wall -lm`
